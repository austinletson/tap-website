AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT OR TAP TECHNOLOGIES INC.’S SERVICES SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY BY FINAL AND BINDING, BILATERAL ARBITRATION, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.

          <br> <br>  <h9> Arbitration Rules and Governing Law </h9> <br>
          Notwithstanding your and Tap Technologies Inc’s agreement that Delaware law governs interpretation and application of these Terms generally, you and Tap Technologies Inc. further hereby agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (“FAA”), applies to this agreement to arbitrate, and governs all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.
          Unless you and Tap Technologies Inc agree otherwise in writing, the arbitration shall be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”), pursuant to JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (JAMS Streamlined Rules”), as modified by this agreement, and consistent with JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness (“JAMS Consumer Fairness Standards”). The arbitrator must honor the terms and limitations in the agreement and can award damages and relief, including any attorneys’ fees authorized by law. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND TAP TECHNOLOGIES INC. ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
          <br> <br> Notwithstanding JAMS Streamlined Rule 8(b), you and Tap Technologies Inc. agree that any dispute as to the arbitrability of a claim brought by either you or Tap Technologies Inc. shall be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction.
          <br><br> THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT ALLOW CLASS ARBITRATIONS EVEN IF THE PROCEDURES OR RULES OF JAMS WOULD. RATHER, YOU AND TAP TECHNOLOGIES INC. ARE ONLY ENTITLED TO PURSUE ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. FURTHER, AND UNLESS YOU AND JOYA COMMUNICATIONS INC. AGREE OTHERWISE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIMS WITH ANY OTHER PARTY’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR COLLECTIVE PROCEEDING.
          <br> <br>  <h9> The Arbitrator’s Decision</h9><br>
          The arbitrator will render an award in accordance with JAMS Streamlined Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Tap Technologies Inc will not seek, and hereby waives all rights Tap Technologies Inc may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if Tap Technologies prevails in arbitration, unless you assert a frivolous claim.
          <br> The arbitrator’s decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
          <br> <br> <h9> Location &amp; Fees </h9><br>
          Unless you and Tap Technologies Inc. agree otherwise in writing, the arbitration will take place in-person in the county in which Tap decides.
          <br><br> If you initiate an arbitration for claims arising from this agreement, you will be required to pay $250 of the fee required to initiate the arbitration and Joya Communications Inc. will pay any remaining JAMS Case Management Fees and all professional fees for the arbitrator’s services; you will remain responsible for your respective costs relating to counsel, experts, witnesses, and travel to the arbitration.
          <br><br>  If Tap Technologies Inc. initiates an arbitration for claims arising from this agreement, Tap technologies Inc. will pay all administrative fees and costs related to the arbitration, including all professional fees for the arbitrator’s services; you will remain responsible for your costs relating to counsel, experts, witnesses, and travel to the arbitration.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction. This agreement to arbitrate does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against Tap Technologies Inc. on your behalf.
